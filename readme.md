# Day 6 of My of My 3 Weeks Game Challenge

I'm not sure if Colour Switch is a good name for this game but I couldn't come up with anything better and didn't want to spend more time on the name itself than writing the code.

The rules are simple. Click on the darker colour as fast as you can.

If you enjoyed this game, you can check out some of the other ones from my [3 weeks game challenge](https://github.com/zsoltime/game-challenge).
